**Custom 3D Rendering Engine for Models and Mathematical Functions**

A from-scratch 3D rendering engine written in Java, supporting both polygonal 3D models and mathematical function visualisation.
This project implements a complete graphics pipeline using linear algebra principles and a modular object-oriented architecture.

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a custom 3D graphics engine without relying on external rendering libraries (such as OpenGL or Java3D).

The engine supports:

- Rendering of polygonal 3D models  
- Visualisation of mathematical functions in 3D space  
- Custom camera controls and projections  
- Real-time transformations and interaction  
- A structured and extensible OOP architecture  

The core goal of this project was to deeply understand and implement the mathematics behind computer graphics rather than relying on pre-built engines.
